## How it works?
The Bit Scrambling Cipher algorithm is a stream cipher that operates on binary data. It takes a key as input and uses it to encrypt and decrypt messages. Here's the algorithm explained step by step:

1. Import the necessary libraries and define the `bitVector` type using `std::vector<bool>`.
2. Define helper functions `stringToBitVector` and `bitVectorToString` to convert strings to bit vectors and vice versa.
3. Define the class `StreamCipherAlgorithm` to encapsulate the cipher functionality.
4. The constructor of `StreamCipherAlgorithm` takes a `key` as input and initializes the key member variable with it. It also converts the key into a bit vector using the `stringToBitVector` helper function and stores it in the `key_in_bit_vector` member variable.
5. The `encrypt` method of `StreamCipherAlgorithm` takes a message as input and returns the encrypted ciphertext. It operates as follows:
    * Convert the message into a bit vector using the `stringToBitVector` helper function.
    * Create an empty bit vector called `cipher_in_bit_vector` with the same size as the message.
    * Initialize pointers `p`, `q`, `r`, and `s` to iterate over the message, key bit vector, ciphertext bit vector, and a pointer to the previous element in the ciphertext bit vector.
    * Iterate over each bit in the message:
        * If the current bit of the key is 1, copy the corresponding bit from the message to the ciphertext and move the `r` pointer.
        * If the current bit of the key is 0, invert the current bit of the message and copy it to the ciphertext using the s pointer, then move the `s` pointer.
        * Move the `p` and `q` pointers to the next bit in the message and key bit vector, respectively.
        * If the end of the key is reached, reset the `q` pointer to the beginning of the key.
    * Convert the ciphertext bit vector to a string using the `bitVectorToString` helper function and return it as the encrypted ciphertext.
6. The `decrypt` method of `StreamCipherAlgorithm` takes a ciphertext as input and returns the decrypted message. It operates in a similar manner to the `encrypt` method:
    * Convert the ciphertext into a bit vector.
    * Create an empty bit vector called `msg_in_bit_vector` with the same size as the ciphertext.
    * Initialize pointers `p, q, r`, and `s` to iterate over the message, key bit vector, ciphertext bit vector, and a pointer to the previous element in the ciphertext bit vector.
    * Iterate over each bit in the ciphertext:
        * If the current bit of the key is 1, copy the corresponding bit from the ciphertext to the message and move the `p` pointer.
        * If the current bit of the key is 0, invert the current bit of the ciphertext using the `s` pointer and copy it to the message, then move the `s` pointer.
        * Move the `p` and `q` pointers to the next bit in the message and key bit vector, respectively.
        * If the end of the key is reached, reset the `q` pointer to the beginning of the key.
    * Convert the message bit vector to a string using the `bitVectorToString` helper function and return it as the decrypted message.

This algorithm implements a simple stream cipher that scrambles the bits of the input message based on the key. It uses `XOR operations` to modify the bits of the message, providing a form of encryption and decryption.


## Description

This algorithm performs bit scrambling encryption and decryption on a given message using a key. The encryption process scrambles the bits of the message, while the decryption process reverses the scrambling to retrieve the original message.

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bit-scrambling-cipher.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd bit-scrambling-cipher
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```
    make
    ```

## Usage

1. Import the `StreamCipherAlgorithm` class from the `bit_scrambling_cipher.h` header file into your code.

2. Create a `StreamCipherAlgorithm` object by providing a key:
    ```
    StreamCipherAlgorithm cipher("your-key");
    ```
3. Encrypt a message:
    ```
    std::string encrypted = cipher.encrypt("your-message");
    ```
4. Decrypt a cipher text:
    ```
    std::string decrypted = cipher.decrypt("your-cipher-text");
    ```

## Examples

Encrypting a message:
```
#include <iostream>
#include "bit_scrambling_cipher.h"

int main() {
    StreamCipherAlgorithm cipher("your-key");

    std::string message = "Hello, World!";
    std::string encrypted = cipher.encrypt(message);

    std::cout << "Encrypted: " << encrypted << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Decrypting a cipher text:
```
#include "bit_scrambling_cipher.h"

int main() {
    StreamCipherAlgorithm cipher("your-key");

    std::string cipherText = "your-cipher-text";
    std::string decrypted = cipher.decrypt(cipherText);

    std::cout << "Decrypted: " << decrypted << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
